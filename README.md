# Project-1--Movies
1st Data science project, making recommedations towards Microsoft when they create a new movie studio
 
Business Problem: 
Microsoft has decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
