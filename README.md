# Project-1--Movies
1st Data science project, making recommedations towards Microsoft when they create a new movie studio
 
Business Problem: 
Microsoft has decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.  

Data Sources:
https://github.com/daniellejenkins17/dsc-phase-1-project-v2-4
Box Office Mojo CSV,
Movie Info TSV,
TMDB Movies CSV,
Movie Budgets CSV

Data Cleaning: Removed unnecessary columns and Pandas joined columns that were useful 

Overview of findings:
-Summer and Holiday months were more profitable than others
-Movie release years had a big impact on profit
-Movie profits are affected by runtime (75-150 minute movies were most profitable)
-Gaining insight into the most successful studios is important 
-Studio popularity does not correlate with profit
